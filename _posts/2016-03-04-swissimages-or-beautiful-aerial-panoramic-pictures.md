Swissimages.com was first launched in 1997 and had become during the next 2 years the first swiss photography website dedicated to the promotion of photographer's works and events related to swiss images. Based on flash technology (... perhaps a bit early ...), it received a praise from the critics.

Today, swissimages.com is a High-Definition Photography Service & Image Bank.
